- Amazon Web Services (AWS) is Amazon’s cloud web hosting platform that offers flexible, reliable, scalable, easy-to-use, and cost-effective solutions.Amazon Web Services (AWS) is Amazon’s cloud web hosting platform that offers flexible, reliable, scalable, easy-to-use, and cost-effective solutions.

- In 2006, Amazon Web Services (AWS) started to offer IT services to the market in the form of web services, which is nowadays known as cloud computing.

What is Cloud Computing?

- Cloud computing is an internet-based computing service in which large groups of remote servers are networked to allow centralized data storage, and online access to computer services or resources.

- Cloud computing is a model that enables the following features.

	•	Users can provision and release resources on-demand.
	•	Resources can be scaled up or down automatically, depending on the load.
	•	Resources are accessible over a network with proper security.
	•	Cloud service providers can enable a pay-as-you-go model

Types of Clouds

i. Public Cloud : the third-party service providers make resources and services available to their customers via Internet. 

ii. Private Cloud : also provides almost similar features as public cloud, but the data and services are managed by the organization or by the third party only for the customer’s organization. 

iii. Hybrid Cloud : is the combination of both private and public cloud. The decision to run on private or public cloud usually depends on various parameters like sensitivity of data and applications.


Cloud Service Models
i. IaaS :  Infrastructure as a Service. It provides users with the capability to provision processing, storage, and network connectivity on demand.  
- the customers can develop their own applications on these resources.
ii. PaaS : Platform as a Service. the service provider provides various services like databases, queues, workflow engines, e-mails, etc. to their customers. The customer can then use these components for building their own applications. 

iii. SaaS : Software as a Service. the third-party providers provide end-user applications to their customers with some administrative capability at the application level, such as the ability to create and manage their users. 

- Also some level of customizability is possible such as the customers can use their own corporate logos, colors, etc.

Advantages of Cloud Computing

	•	Cost-Efficient 

	•	Reliability 

	•	Unlimited Storage 

	•	Backup & Recovery 

	•	Easy Access to Information 


Disadvantages of Cloud Computing

- Security issues

- Technical issues

- Not easy to switch service providers


+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Amazon Web Services - Basic Architecture

i. Load Balancing

- AWS provides the Elastic Load Balancing service, it distributes the traffic to EC2 instances across multiple available sources
- Elastic Load Balancing can dynamically grow and shrink the load-balancing capacity to adjust to traffic demands 
ii. Amazon Cloud-front
- It’s responsible for content delivery, i.e. used to deliver website. 
- it’s optimized to work with other Amazon Web Services, like Amazon S3 and Amazon EC2. 
- It also works fine with any non-AWS origin server and stores the original files in a similar manner.

iii. Elastic Load Balancer

- It is used to spread the traffic to web servers, which improves performance. 
- AWS provides the Elastic Load Balancing service, in which traffic is distributed to EC2 instances over multiple available zones
- and dynamic addition and removal of Amazon EC2 hosts from the load-balancing rotation.
iv. Security Management

- Amazon’s Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) provides a feature called security groups, which is similar to an inbound network firewall, 
- in which we have to specify the protocols, ports, and source IP ranges that are allowed to reach your EC2 instances.
v. Elastic Caches

- Amazon Elastic Cache is a web service that manages the memory cache in the cloud. 
- In memory management, cache has a very important role and helps to reduce the load on the services, improves the performance and scalability on the database tier by caching frequently used information.

vi. Amazon RDS

- Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service) provides a similar access as that of MySQL, Oracle, or Microsoft SQL Server database engine. The same queries, applications, and tools can be used with Amazon RDS.
- It automatically patches the database software and manages backups as per the user’s instruction. 
- It also supports point-in-time recovery. 
vii. Hosting RDMS on EC2 Instances
- Amazon RDS allows users to install RDBMS (Relational Database Management System) of your choice like MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, DB2, etc. on an EC2 instance and can manage as required.
- Amazon EC2 uses Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Storage) similar to network-attached storage. 
- All data and logs running on EC2 instances should be placed on Amazon EBS volumes, which will be available even if the database host fails.
- Amazon EBS volumes automatically provide redundancy within the availability zone, which increases the availability of simple disks. 
viii. Storage & Backups
- AWS cloud provides various options for storing, accessing, and backing up web application data and assets. 
-The Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) provides a simple web-services interface that can be used to store and retrieve any amount of data, at any time, from anywhere on the web.
- Amazon S3 stores data as objects within resources called buckets. 
- The user can store as many objects as per requirement within the bucket, and can read, write and delete objects from the bucket.
- Amazon EBS is effective for data that needs to be accessed as block storage and requires persistence beyond the life of the running instance, such as database partitions and application logs.
ix. Auto Scaling
- The difference between AWS cloud architecture and the traditional hosting model is that AWS can dynamically scale the web application fleet on demand to handle changes in traffic.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ AWS - Elastic Compute Cloud

- Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is a web service interface that provides resizable compute capacity in the AWS cloud.

- EC2 instances can be resized and the number of instances scaled up or down as per our requirement.

- EC2 Components :

	+ Operating System Support : Amazon EC2 supports multiple OS in which we need to pay additional licensing fees like: Red Hat Enterprise, SUSE Enterprise and Oracle Enterprise Linux, UNIX, Windows Server, etc.

	+ Security : Users have complete control over the visibility of their AWS account. the security systems allow create groups and place running instances into it as per the requirement

	+ Pricing : WS offers a variety of pricing options, depending on the type of resources, types of applications and database.

	+ Fault tolerance : Amazon EC2 allows the users to access its resources to design fault-tolerant applications. also comprises geographic regions and isolated locations known as availability zones for fault tolerance and stability.

	+ Migration : This service allows the users to move existing applications into EC2
